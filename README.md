## Objective 1: Loan Default Prediction

### Overview
This notebook focuses on predicting the likelihood of loan defaults using historical data. It aims to help financial institutions make informed decisions about lending by identifying potential risks.

### Methodology
1. **Importing Packages:**
   - Essential Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and machine learning frameworks are imported.

2. **Data Import and Exploration:**
   - Loan-related datasets are loaded and inspected for structure, completeness, and initial insights.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visual techniques (e.g., scatterplots and barplots) are used to understand trends and relationships in the data.

4. **Model Preparation:**
   - Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.

5. **Model Initialization:**
   - Machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) are initialized and prepared for training.

6. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Models are trained, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are computed
   -  A confusion matrix is used to visualize the model's performance.

## Objective 2: Price Prediction

### Overview
This notebook aims to predict the prices of items or services based on various features. It can be applied to domains such as real estate, retail, and e-commerce.

### Methodology
1. **Importing Packages:**
   - Relevant Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization are imported.

2. **Data Import and Exploration:**
   - The dataset is loaded, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - New features are created, and existing features are transformed to enhance predictive power.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - A lineplot was created to better understand data.

5. **Model Preparation:**
   - Data is preprocessed, including normalization, handling outliers, and splitting into training/testing sets.

6. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Machine learning models such as linear regression and random forest regressors are trained.
   - Regression plots are used to visualize their performance

7. **Price Prediction Logic:**
   - Models are trained to predict prices, and results are evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

8. **Price Predictor:**
   - The finalized model is used for price prediction on new data.
